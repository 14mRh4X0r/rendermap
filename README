Description
---
MapRenderer is a tool used to render PNG images out of the Minecraft ingame
map data at various scales (TODO!)

---
Dependencies:
---
   - libcppnbt (http://github.com/FliPPeh/cppNBT)
   - libz      (http://zlib.org)
   - libpng    (http://www.libpng.org/)

---
Building
---
Asuming libcppnbt is in the current working directory (either as static or
shared library), libz and libpng either installed globally or similar to
libcppnbt, running 'make' will do the job. Otherwise minor modification
to the Makefile will have to be done to include the correct search paths.

Running 'make' will create an executable file called "rendermap".

---
Usage Example
---
$ rendermap Map_0.dat
# This will create the image "Map_0.dat.png" in the current directory
